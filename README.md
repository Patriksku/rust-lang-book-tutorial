# rust-lang-book-tutorial

The code in this repository follows the ["The Rust Lang Book"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLai5B987bZ9CoVR-QEIN9foz4QCJ0H2Y8) tutorial series on Rust, created by ["Let's Get Rusty"](https://www.youtube.com/@letsgetrusty) on YouTube.
The tutorial series is based on the official ["The Rust Programming Language"](https://www.youtube.com/@letsgetrusty) book. A lot of the code in this repository is therefore the same, or modified. I have largely reused code and added comments to better understand the different parts.

The licenses and copyright notices from the ["rust-lang / book"](https://github.com/rust-lang/book) GitHub repository are included in this repository.
