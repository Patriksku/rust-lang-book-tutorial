You can install binaries into the rust installation directory by running 'cargo install <package>'.
We have installed ripgrep like so: 'cargo install ripgrep'. And now we have the Rust version of 'grep' installed.
We can call it by 'rg ...'.

If we have a binary in our installation directory that starts with 'cargo-', for instance 'cargo-hello', then we can
use this as a subcommand to cargo. So we would then be able to run 'cargo hello ...'.
This means that you can extend 'cargo' without modifying its code.
